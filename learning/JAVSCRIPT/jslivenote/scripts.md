what is AJAX (AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)

!key points
1. Event Occurs: An event (such as a button click) triggers an AJAX request.

2. Request Sent: JavaScript makes an HTTP request (usually via the XMLHttpRequest)
object or the Fetch API) to the server.

3. Server Response: The server processes the request and sends back data, often in JSON or XML format.


4. Update Page: JavaScript processes the response and updates the web page dynamically without a full reload.

AJAX enhances user experience by making web applications faster and more responsive. 
Itâ€™s commonly used for features like form submissions, live search, and real-time updates.



what is JSON? (javascript objects notation)

Key Characteristics:
1. Text-Based: JSON is a text format, making it easy to read and debug.

2. Language Independent: While JSON is based on JavaScript syntax, it is language-independent, with many programming languages supporting it.

3. Data Structure: JSON represents data as key-value pairs. Keys are strings, and values can be strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, or other JSON objects.

You can easily parse JSON data into a JavaScript object using JSON.parse(), and you can convert a JavaScript object to a JSON string using JSON.stringify()
